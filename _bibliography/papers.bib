  	abstract = {Chronic wounds arise from interruption of normal healing due to many potential pathophysiological factors. Monitoring these multivariate factors can provide personalized diagnostic information for wound management, but current sensing technologies use complex laboratory tests or track a limited number of wound parameters. We report a flexible biosensing platform for multiplexed profiling of the wound microenvironment, inflammation, and infection state at the point of care. This platform integrates a sensor array for measuring inflammatory mediators [tumor necrosis factor\textendash{$\alpha$}, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and transforming growth factor\textendash{$\beta$}1], microbial burden (Staphylococcus aureus), and physicochemical parameters (temperature and pH) with a microfluidic wound exudate collector and flexible electronics for wireless, smartphone-based data readout. We demonstrate in situ multiplexed monitoring in a mouse wound model and also profile wound exudates from patients with venous leg ulcers. This technology may facilitate more timely and personalized wound management to improve chronic wound healing outcomes. An integrated smart microfluidic dressing with a multibiomarker immunosensor can provide in situ wound status profiling on site.

  	abstract = {The ability to transmit wireless signals into the body is important for medical communication, sensing, and powering technologies. However, the efficiency of signal transmission is limited by the large reflection encountered at the interface between air and biological tissue. Here, we demonstrate an approach to overcome this reflection using cascaded metasurfaces with deeply subwavelength thickness to transform the wave impedance at the air-tissue interface. We develop a procedure to systematically synthesize these metasurfaces using multilayer tissue model that can account for different body compositions. Using this procedure, we design a three-layer metasurface operating at 2.45 GHz with {$\lambda$}/24.5 thickness. Full-wave simulations in a computational human body model show that the metasurface provides transmission equivalent to replacing the background with a tissue-matched medium, while experimental measurements demonstrate 12.1 dB enhancement of transmission into a multilayer tissue phantom.},

	abstract = {Radio-frequency technologies are capable of remotely sensing human vital signs for broad applications in healthcare. However, their use during daily life is hindered by challenges such as environmental interference, low sensitivity, and non-ideal form factors. Here, we report a radio-frequency sensor made from a conductive textile that provides sensitive non-contact monitoring of vital signs. The sensor (13 cm2 in size) comprises a radial pattern of grooves that support spoof localized surface plasmon (LSP) modes and a ground plane with a complementary window that controls the sensor's interaction with the body. These spoof LSP modes provide a sharp resonant dip and a broadly tunable evanescent field that enables tracking of heartbeat and respiration via the |S11| spectrum measured in a connector-free manner. We establish the optimal operating mode of the sensor and show that it provides a resonant frequency shift of 250 MHz for respiration and 100 MHz for heartbeat motions. Experiments with a healthy human subject show that the measured heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) are in close agreement with gold standard sensors and are robust to daily activities performed while sitting.},

	abstract = {Vital sign monitoring is important for determining the health status and well-being of an individual. Despite their high level of accuracy, clinical sensing methods for vital signs, such as heart or respiration signals, often require direct skin contact and the use of wires, making them restrictive and inconvenient. In contrast, alternative sensing approaches using wireless means can be comfortable for users and are suitable for long-term, continuous health monitoring scenarios. Recent advances in physiological sensing using Doppler radars present great potential for non-contact vital sign monitoring, but face many challenges due to background clutter and large body motions. In this work, we develop an integrated system for non-contact vital sign monitoring based on microwave metamaterials and software-defined Doppler radar. Our sensor is thin, flexible, and able to monitor health through clothing. We demonstrate our system's capability in respiration and cardiac sensing through experiments on a healthy volunteer and validate its cardiac sensing accuracy against electrocardiography as the gold standard. Validation results show a Pearson's correlation coefficient r ≈ 0.9 and Bland-Altman agreement limits of ±37.1 ms between our sensor's and the gold standard's estimation of heart beat-to-beat intervals.},

	abstract = {Implanted bioelectronic devices can form distributed networks capable of sensing health conditions and delivering therapy throughout the body. Current clinically-used approaches for wireless communication, however, do not support direct networking between implants because of signal losses from absorption and reflection by the body. As a result, existing examples of such networks rely on an external relay device that needs to be periodically recharged and constitutes a single point of failure. Here, we demonstrate direct implant-to-implant wireless networking at the scale of the human body using metamaterial textiles. The textiles facilitate non-radiative propagation of radio-frequency signals along the surface of the body, passively amplifying the received signal strength by more than three orders of magnitude (>30 dB) compared to without the textile. Using a porcine model, we demonstrate closed-loop control of the heart rate by wirelessly networking a loop recorder and a vagus nerve stimulator at more than 40 cm distance. Our work establishes a wireless technology to directly network body-integrated devices for precise and adaptive bioelectronic therapies.},

	abstract = {Continuous in-vehicle physiological monitoring can improve safety through early detection of driver fatigue and drowsiness. However, developing a system capable of effective and robust physiological monitoring in practical driving scenarios is challenging due to the noisy vehicular environment in which the sensor is exposed to engine vibrations, unpredictable road conditions and random body motions. In this work, we introduce a seatbelt-integrated metamaterial sensor for unobtrusive and continuous in-vehicle respiration and heartbeat monitoring. The metamaterial sensor is fabricated by digital embroidery of conductive threads and can continuously monitor respiration and heartbeat in a contactless manner. Our sensor supports confined microwave surface waves that are modulated by subtle local physiological motions, which are sensitively transduced into changes in the phase of the transmitted signal. We developed an algorithm based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) for noise-robust extraction of respiration and heart rate. We experimentally demonstrate the embroidered metamaterial in real-life driving scenarios and show accurate heartbeat detection with a median inter-beat interval (IBI) detection error of 23.5 ms during driving. Our results highlight the potential of embroidered metamaterial sensors in driver physiological monitoring applications, especially for the unobtrusive detection of fatigue and drowsiness.},
