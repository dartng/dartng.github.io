  abstract = {Chronic wounds arise from interruption of normal healing due to many potential pathophysiological factors. Monitoring these multivariate factors can provide personalized diagnostic information for wound management, but current sensing technologies use complex laboratory tests or track a limited number of wound parameters. We report a flexible biosensing platform for multiplexed profiling of the wound microenvironment, inflammation, and infection state at the point of care. This platform integrates a sensor array for measuring inflammatory mediators [tumor necrosis factor\textendash{$\alpha$}, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and transforming growth factor\textendash{$\beta$}1], microbial burden (Staphylococcus aureus), and physicochemical parameters (temperature and pH) with a microfluidic wound exudate collector and flexible electronics for wireless, smartphone-based data readout. We demonstrate in situ multiplexed monitoring in a mouse wound model and also profile wound exudates from patients with venous leg ulcers. This technology may facilitate more timely and personalized wound management to improve chronic wound healing outcomes. An integrated smart microfluidic dressing with a multibiomarker immunosensor can provide in situ wound status profiling on site.

	abstract = {Layered structures are widely used in optics to control wave reflection and propagation at interfaces but their thickness relative to the wavelength hinders their application in the radio-frequency regime. Here, we design and experimentally demonstrate cascaded metasurfaces with deeply subwavelength thickness that provide both antireflection and wavefront manipulation. We describe the systematic synthesis of the metasurface layers from a prescribed scattering response and demonstrate designs capable of providing near-perfect microwave transmission through glass as well as antireflection focusing of wireless signals from air into water.},
