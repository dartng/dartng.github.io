I am a Research Scientist at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/). My current research lies at the intersection of novel wireless technologies, signal processing, and machine learning for human-centric sensing applications.

I received my PhD from the National University of Singapore in December 2023, under the guidance of [Assoc. Prof. John Ho](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=Uw83cL4AAAAJ&hl=en). My doctoral thesis focused on wireless physiological sensing applications of microwave metamaterials.
