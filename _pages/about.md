I am a PhD candidate in the [Integrative Sciences and Engineering Program, NUS Graduate School](https://isep.nus.edu.sg) under [Assoc. Prof. John Ho](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=Uw83cL4AAAAJ&hl=en) and the [Wireless Bioelectronics Group](https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/hsyj/index.html). I am also affiliated with the [N.1 Institute for Health](https://n1labs.org/) and the [Institute for Health Innovation and Technology (iHealthTech)](https://ihealthtech.nus.edu.sg/).

My current research interests lie broadly in novel wireless sensing technologies and their applications in health monitoring and biomedicine. My recent work focuses on non-contact physiological sensing using microwave metamaterials combined with digital signal processing and machine learning techniques.
